# Regression---Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction

## Introduction

● The project aims to predict Yes Bank's stock closing price using historical stock market data.

● It utilizes machine learning regression models to capture patterns and trends from past performance.

● The dataset includes features such as Open, High, Low, Volume, and Closing Price.

● The goal is to support financial decision-making by offering reliable forecasts.

## Problem Statement

● Stock prices are influenced by numerous volatile factors, making accurate predictions challenging.

● Traditional statistical models often fall short in capturing nonlinear relationships in stock data.

● This project explores whether machine learning algorithms can better predict Yes Bank's closing prices using historical data.

● The key problem is:
“Can we build a model to predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock based on past stock performance data?”

## Summary

● Data was loaded and preprocessed from a CSV file, handling missing values and converting dates.

● Visualizations (line plots, heatmaps) were used to understand data trends and feature correlations.

● Two models were built and evaluated:

● Linear Regression

● Decision Tree Regressor

● Performance was measured using MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

● Decision Tree performed better than Linear Regression, indicating better handling of nonlinear relationships.

● Model accuracy was not perfect, reflecting the complexity of stock price prediction.

## Conclusion
 
● Machine learning models like Decision Trees can provide decent predictive performance for stock closing prices.

● Stock price prediction remains inherently complex due to market volatility and external factors.

● Data preprocessing and feature engineering play a crucial role in improving model accuracy.

● With further tuning and additional features (like news sentiment, macroeconomic indicators), the model’s performance can be enhanced.

● This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in financial forecasting and trading strategy support.
